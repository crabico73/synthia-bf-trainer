Abstract The Structural Cosmology (SC) hypothesis proposes that the observable 13.8 billion-year history of our universe is experienced as a single, infinitesimal computational event from the perspective of a host structure. This hypothesis is grounded in two quantifiable pillars: (1) The extreme time dilation near the Schwarzschild radius of a universe-mass analogue, requiring a fractional proximity of 1-rs/r  5.3×10-36 for a 1-second external event; and (2) The structural organization of matter via a clustered distribution of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We propose an extended log-normal PBH mass function peaked at asteroidto-dwarf-planet masses (1020­1024 g), designed to satisfy current constraints while providing gravitational seeds for the cosmic web. The model predicts that PBHs constitute 10­30% of the apparent dark matter mass in galactic halos. This framework is falsifiable: we provide scaling estimates for gravitational microlensing surveys, anticipating an excess of short-duration events in the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope data and a high-mass tail detectable by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST). Non-detection at predicted levels would falsify the hypothesis that PBHs provide the primary gravitational seeds for cosmic structure.
1 Introduction: The Unified Structure and Time Asymmetry
The Structural Cosmology (SC) hypothesis is motivated by the apparent structural self-similarity observed between the large-scale cosmic web and biological neural networks [Vazza & Feletti, 2020]. We propose that this similarity is indicative of a fundamental, scale-invariant informational system [Wheeler, 1990]. Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed supermassive black holes at redshifts z > 10 that appear overmassive relative to their host galaxies [Maiolino & Uebler, 2023], challenging standard models of black hole formation. The convergence of these observations with theoretical primordial black hole (PBH) models has attracted mainstream attention, highlighting the need for quantitative, falsifiable predictions.
The primary objective of this paper is to provide a testable framework for SC, addressing the foundational questions of time and structure:
1. What is the General Relativistic condition required for our entire cosmic history to constitute a single external event?
2. What mechanism seeds the self-similar structure of the cosmic web and accounts for current cosmological anomalies, such as early supermassive black holes?
3. What are the near-future observational tests that can falsify or confirm this model?

The SC hypothesis treats the mass of the observable universe (Muniverse  1053 kg) as an analogue for the central mass in a Schwarzschild metric. While the static Schwarzschild solution differs from the internal dynamic Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime, it serves as a heuristic scaling estimate for the gravitational redshift required by the SC compression premise near an effective horizon-like boundary.

2.1 Schwarzschild Radius and Dimensional Consistency

The Schwarzschild radius (rs) for this mass is:

rs

=

2GMuniverse c2



1.48 × 1026 m

This value is dimensionally comparable to the Hubble radius ( 1.3 × 1026 m); we treat this as a suggestive scaling coincidence motivating the boundary-analogy.

2.2 Scaling of Time Compression

We investigate the relationship between the proper time experienced locally (us) and the coordinate time of the host structure (Thost). Using the time dilation formula for a stationary observer at radius r:

dus =

1

-

rs r

dThost

Let Thost denote the characteristic external coordinate timescale of the host structure. Then the required metric

compression is:

1 - rs = Thost = 1 - rs = Thost 2

r us

r

us

As a worked example to illustrate the extreme time dilation possible, if we set the host timescale to Thost = 1 s and the internal history to us  13.8 × 109 yr, we derive the required proximity parameter:

1 - rs  5.3 × 10-36 r

This result quantifies the fine-tuning that would be required for the "single computational event" hypothesis. While this extreme value suggests the time compression mechanism alone cannot be the complete explanation, it motivates our investigation of alternative structure formation mechanisms that might produce similar observational signatures.

3 Cosmological Structure: Primordial Black Holes as Seeds
We propose that the mass within cosmic structures is organized by a population of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed during inflation. This mechanism addresses both the structural organization of the cosmic web and the rapid formation of supermassive black holes observed at high redshift.

3.1 The SC PBH Mass Function

We define a normalized log-normal shape (M) such that (M) d ln M = 1, and the dark matter fraction in PBHs is fPBH. Then the mass function is given by:

d fPBH d ln M

=

fPBH (M)

where the shape function (M) arises from non-slow-roll inflationary models [Özsoy & Tasinato, 2023]:

(M) = 1 exp  2

-

ln2(M/M0) 2 2

The parameters are defined as:

2

· Peak Mass (M0): Set to the asteroid-to-dwarf-planet mass scale (M0  [1020, 1024] g, approximately 10-13 to 10-9 M). This range avoids the strongest evaporation and microlensing constraints [Carr et al., 2021] while providing high number density for clustering.
· High-Mass Tail: Extends to  1030­1035 g (10-3­102 M), providing intermediate-mass black hole seeds for the early supermassive black holes observed by JWST [Maiolino & Uebler, 2023]. The distribution width  is treated as a free parameter determined by the specific inflationary potential, with   0.5­1.0 being typical for inflation-generated perturbations.
· Low-Mass Tail: Extends down to  109 g, assuming extended lifetimes due to the "Memory Burden Effect" [Alexandre et al., 2024], which predicts quantum corrections significantly extend PBH lifetimes beyond standard Hawking evaporation timescales.
3.2 Structural Role and Apparent Dark Matter
The SC PBH population is predicted to be highly clustered. This clustering is crucial for two structural outcomes:
1. Cosmic Web Topology: The initial cluster distribution defines the filamentary structure of the cosmic web. To facilitate falsifiability, we parameterize this clustering by positing that PBHs reside in substructures of characteristic multiplicity Nc with local number density nc, enhancing the effective optical depth in dense regions.
2. Dark Matter Component: We propose that PBHs constitute fPBH = 0.10­0.30 (10­30%) of the apparent dark matter mass in galactic halos. The kinematic signatures attributed to canonical smooth dark matter halos arise from the collective gravitational potential of this granular, clustered PBH population. The remaining 70­90% of apparent dark matter signatures may arise from a combination of Population III stellar remnants, baryonic dark matter in compact objects, and potentially emergent gravitational effects as proposed by Verlinde's entropic gravity framework [Verlinde, 2017]. A complete accounting of the galactic mass budget requires further theoretical development beyond the scope of this paper.
4 Observational Tests and Falsifiability
The SC hypothesis is falsifiable through gravitational microlensing surveys. The microlensing event duration (tE) is directly proportional to the square root of the lensing mass, allowing surveys to constrain the underlying PBH mass function through statistical analysis of event durations.
4.1 Detection Predictions
1. Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman):
· Sensitivity: Optimized for the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), monitoring  200 million stars with 15-minute cadence over six observing seasons [DeRocco et al., 2024].
· SC Prediction: We anticipate an excess of asteroid/dwarf-planet mass PBHs (M  1022­1024 g, approximately Earth-mass), corresponding to event durations of order hours to  1 day. Based on scaling estimates (see Appendix A), we predict  30­100 events (order-of-magnitude), conditional on cadence, photometric precision, blending cuts, and detection efficiency, if fPBH  0.1. For fPBH = 0.3, the prediction increases to  100­300 events. This represents a statistically significant excess (3­5 ) above the expected free-floating planet background of  10 events [Penny et al., 2019].
2. Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST):
3

· Sensitivity: Wide-field coverage (18,000 deg2) monitoring billions of stars over 10 years, sensitive to longer timescales [Ivezic´ et al., 2019].
· SC Prediction: An excess of long-duration events consistent with the high-mass PBH tail (M  1­ 103 M), with event durations of weeks to months. Based on scaling estimates, we predict  50­200 solar-mass PBH events over the 10-year survey for fPBH = 0.1, increasing to  150­600 events for fPBH = 0.3. The spatial distribution of events should show clustering consistent with a spherical halo distribution rather than a thin disk, testing the cosmic web seeding mechanism.
4.2 Falsification Conditions
The SC hypothesis is falsified if:
· Non-detection by Roman: The number of short-duration microlensing events is statistically consistent with the free-floating planet background only (< 10 events by 2033), ruling out a PBH component > 5% of dark matter in the asteroid-mass range.
· Incorrect Mass Function: The statistical analysis of event durations yields a mass function that is monochromatic (peaked at a single mass) or inconsistent with a log-normal distribution, falsifying the inflation-generated formation mechanism.
· Uniform Spatial Distribution: LSST's spatial analysis of microlensing events shows a uniform distribution or concentration in the Galactic disk rather than the predicted spherical halo clustering, falsifying the cosmic web seeding mechanism.
· Smooth Dark Matter Halos: Future weak gravitational lensing surveys (e.g., Euclid) place strong constraints on halo substructure requiring > 95% of dark matter to be in a smooth, diffuse component, ruling out a significant compact object contribution.
5 Discussion and Conclusion
The Structural Cosmology hypothesis provides a unified framework linking General Relativistic time dilation to cosmic structure formation. By parameterizing the time compression ratio, we establish a quantitative link between the "host time" and the universe's proximity to a horizon-like boundary. While the extreme fine-tuning (10-36) required for the time compression mechanism suggests it cannot be the sole explanation, it motivates investigation of alternative structure formation mechanisms.
The proposed log-normal PBH mass function offers a specific, falsifiable mechanism for seeding the cosmic web. This model addresses current observational puzzles, including the rapid formation of supermassive black holes at z > 10 observed by JWST and the origin of the filamentary structure of the cosmic web. The predicted detection rates for Roman (30­300 events) and LSST (50­600 events) provide near-term tests (2025­2035) that will either confirm the existence of the gravitational seeds required by the SC model or falsify the core tenet of the hypothesis.
If confirmed, a significant PBH component of dark matter would have profound implications for early universe physics and structure formation, providing direct evidence for enhanced density perturbations during inflation and establishing a concrete link between quantum fluctuations in the first 10-30 seconds and the largescale structure we observe today.

A Microlensing Rate Scaling Estimates

To estimate the expected detection count Ndet, we utilize a simplified scaling relation based on the optical depth  and the event duration tE. The event rate  toward the Galactic Bulge is approximately:





2 

 tE

Ns

where  is the optical depth per source, and the term (2/)(/tE) represents the per-source event rate; multi-

plying by Ns (the number of monitored source stars) gives the total rate. For the Roman GBTDS, we assume Ns  2 × 108 and a target optical depth dominated by PBHs of PBH  fPBH × 10-6.
For a characteristic mass M  1023 g (dwarf planet range, approximately Earth-mass), the Einstein crossing

time tE is on the order of hours to one day (tE  0.1­1 days). The exact duration depends on the lens-source

geometry and transverse velocity. Assuming a survey efficiency   0.3 (accounting for photometric cuts,

blending, and cadence gaps) and a total effective observing time Tobs  1 yr (cumulative over multiple seasons),

the expected yield scales as:

Ndet = Tobs 

fPBH tE

For fPBH = 0.1, this scaling implies Ndet  O(101)­O(102) events, with the range reflecting uncertainties in

detection efficiency, event duration distribution, and clustering enhancement factors. For fPBH = 0.3, the yield

increases proportionally to  30­300 events. We use the detection-efficiency methodology from DeRocco et

al. [2024] and treat our asteroid-mass yield as an order-of-magnitude extrapolation within the SC mass window.

For LSST, the wider field coverage (18,000 deg2) and longer baseline (10 years) provide sensitivity to the

high-mass tail. Using similar scaling arguments with Ns  109 stars (across the full survey area) and longer

event durations (tE  10­100 days for solar-mass objects), we estimate  50­200 events for fPBH = 0.1 and

 150­600 events for fPBH = 0.3. These estimates are conservative and do not include potential clustering

enhancement factors, which could increase detection rates in dense regions along the cosmic web.
